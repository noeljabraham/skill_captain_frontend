    <h1>One reason it’s good to be ugly</h1>
    <h2>Latest research has found that being ugly makes you more memorable than attractive people</h2>
    <p>Researchers from the University of Jena in Germany found that images of unattractive people were more memorable compared to pretty faces. Unless they had noticeable traits like Angelina Jolie’s pillow-shaped lips or Colin Farrell’s bushy eyebrows, beautiful faces are more easily forgotten. So, if you are considered ugly you also have the advantage of being an easily recognisable face.</p>
    <br>
    <p> According to Dr Holger Wiese, who conducted the study along with Carolin Altmann and Stefan Schweinberger, we tend to think that we recognise a face just because it’s attractive. However, this belief is far from the truth. The researchers showed subjects photos of a group of people, half of whom were considered beautiful while the other half was unattractive. They showed the test subjects these faces for a few seconds and asked them to try to memorise the pictures. They showed the snaps to them again and asked whether they recognised them.</p>
